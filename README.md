# This is a WIP project

**Voca** - from vocare, meaning "to call, summon, invite."

Out of curiosity I decided to spin up a small eventing application for personal usage using CAP and UI5. 
Here are some screenshots from current state.

Apart from what you can see - application supports sending emails :)

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

## Next Steps

- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch`
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)
